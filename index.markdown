Hi! My name is Ardiawan Bagus Harisa. I am currently a Computer Science's PhD student at NTUST. My expertise field is Procedural Content Generation (PCG) and Game Artificial Intelligence (AI). I love to discuss anything related to games. 

I created digital things like video games, VR, AR. I also work with my small team in my tiny company Pandonga Studio to create web app and mobile app. 

In my spare time, I also manage my own small board game cafe, Dhadhu Cafe in Semarang, Central Java, as a creative director. I found it challenging and, but also quite mindset-wise opening.
