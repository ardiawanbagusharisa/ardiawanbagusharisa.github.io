Hello, I'm Bagus. I like to discuss about game, whether it be digital or analog. I'm currently a PhD student at NTUST's Computer Science. My research field is procedural content generation and game AI. 

Now, you may come here for one of these reasons: 
1. You know me and want to see my little updates on things related to games, or my CV. 
2. You just randomly click a thing related to game reseach. Of all sites, the probabilities collapsed into a single decision to click this site. It's universe's destiny!! 

So, yeah. Just take a look, um... gentleman.
