This is the first part of the series where I want to share on how to be better and more positive individual, according my observation on the big figures and my own experience running a small cafe, lecturing in a college, and side hustling in software business.  

So, generally, in every Positive+ post, I will share 5 experiences I encountered during struggling on doing my task, mostly from being a cafe manager. Because, from this view, I can see from multiple perspective. Say, as and employer, employee, or even in between.  

## 1. Dream big  
Remember when we were just a kid, we dream big, to be a Superman, Batman, or any other cool super heroes? But now it feels so different after we get punch in the face by reality, time to time? I remember some of my visionary friends told me to still dream big. Because, when your dream is big, even if you get only 10% of it, it is way better than some one who dream small and get 100% of it. In a sense, it is like having high bar or threshold on the level we want to achieve. Yes, people are different. Personally, I choose to dream big even if it almost impossible to achieve. Why won't I become like Albert Einstein? Al-Khawirzmi? Elon Musk? Nurmagomedov? So, set the bar high, but also realise you need the further acompanying steps to reach it. 

## 2. Find the Roadmap  
In my own experience, I often confused about what should I do. Especially, if I don't know the domain. Sometimes we know the roadmap of the things we want to learn, but many times we don't. So, what I would do is simply browse the stuff I want to know, from internet, from friends, even from the people I meet on the streets. Having a roadmap means we also have the sense of progress (where we are right now? 15%? 80%? and so on), which will benefits us more because we realise that we are on the progress to reach the ultimate goal. Moreover, we can also understand someone's pattern of reaching their goal by knowing their roadmap. I think learning someone's why's on doing stuff is also wonderful. It's like you don't know them, but you know them better. 

## 3. Take the first step  
Most of my business partners and figures that I aspire said that the first step is the hardest step. Because we come from the fog area, not knowing what and how to do. But, I have an argument that we can actually learn the pain of fell from one, we try it by ourselves, or two, someone's else's experience. Reading a biography book means we also learn the figure's life and its lessons. Which may safe us lots of times compare to everything we must experience by ourselves. But regardless, just try to take the first step. Like in Warcarft or Dota, the fog will diseappear along your steps. 

## 4. Afraid is okay too  
Having a fear, is really what human should. So, it is okay if we are afraid of things we don't know. Actually, sometimes, fear also our weapon to anticipate the challenge ahead of us. As a muslim, we have the concept of uncertainty of destiny. There are two kinds of destinies, absolut destiny and temporary destiny. The absolute destiny is about the things we will absolutely get, such as die. No one in history, up until now can trick the death. So we must embrace it, by doing the thing we can focus on and make impact to our surrounding. The temporary destiny however, is like a branches of destiny where you can change the road you want to achive your goal. But, of course all of us like the best branch possible. How to do that? By doing our best. So we can change the second destiny with our own hands. Additionally, our surrounding (friends, family, god "universe"), I believe. 

## 5. Embrace what's ahead  
As I mentioned, there are things we know and there are we don't know. Embracing what's ahead is also a good starting steps in reaching our goal. The feeling and the addrenaline pumped to know and to get the future. That alone is art. One of the arts of life. Because we don't know yet what we would get. So, if we are willing and brave enough to embrace the fog of challenge, we are already make a tiny percentage of progress heading to our dream.  

That is for now, I will share more on the next post.
