* Internet is a computer network that interconnects any computing devices (devices can be hosts or end systems). 
(show figure of internet here)
* Protocols are the rules to run the internet, rules to send the message (data) and what actions should be taken regarding to that message. It also defines the message's format, the order, the action should be taken on data transmission, and how to give the receipt upon data arrival.
