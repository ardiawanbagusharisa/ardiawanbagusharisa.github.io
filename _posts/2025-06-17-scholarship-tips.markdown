Here are some tips for you to get a scholarship for a master or doctoral degree. 

Here are the easy step-by-step you can do:  
1. **List some of the Univeristies you may be interested to get into**. As for me, I list some of the University in Asia and Europe, each wich its own trade-off. For an instance, if you want to get into a great University but still relatively easy, then you may choose Universities on top-25-100 from the region. For example, I chose NTUST which is on #46 in Asia in QS 2026.   
2. **Look at its scholarship page**. Take a look into pages that mention whether they provide scholarships or not because not all Universities provide one. You can read all the guidelines there.   
3. **Look at the faculty members or professors**. Take a look at the professor list and list some that have similar or interesting topic to yours. Usually, they provide the list of professor on the University's website. Please, choose it carefully as this professor you will choose will be your advisor in your study. I have seen lots of my friends study performances also depend on their relationships with their professor. Specifically, read their work/ published papers you are interested in. How to boost your acceptance probability? follow the next steps.  
4. **Write a paper, related to the professor's topic**. The idea is to make a portfolio that is closely align with the professor research interest. If you can convinced him that you are a great candidate to work with him, chance is 99% he want to work with you too. The professor, especially the full professor, has a great power to help you lock-in your scholarship provided by their Univeristy of govenrment. So, if you pursue a master scholarship, the best or ideal way is to write a research paper that's closely align with his interest. 
5. **Admission application**. Regardless whether you have already a paper or it's still a draft, just give your shot to apply for the scholarship and follow all the rules. Based on my personal experience, it's best for you to do step 5 after you get step 4 done. Because if you apply one scholarship while having the published work, chance to get accepted is super high. In the same time you may inform the professor you want to aim as your advisor that you are applying for the University and its scholarship. Generally, there are 3 types of scholarship funding in my Univeristy: 
   - **Full**: you get a free scholar fees and a monthly stipend. This is the best case you may get. I got one for my PhD (18k NTD/ month). But, for full and partial scholarships, you still need to pay the dormitory by yourself. 
   - **Partial**: you get a free school fees and half of monthly stipend. It's still worthy to get one. (probably around 12k-15k/ month). 
   - **Tuition waiver only**: you get only the free academic fees. I got this type when I was doing my master, and it made me at least need to do part-time jobs.
